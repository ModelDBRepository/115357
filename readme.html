This is the readme for the model associated with the paper:

R.A.J. van Elburg and A. van Ooyen, `Generalization of the event-based 
Carnevale-Hines integration scheme for integrate-and-fire models', 
Neural Computation, July 2009, Vol. 21, No. 7: 1913-1930. 
(doi:10.1162/neco.2009.07-08-815 )

Files:

Actual implementation of the generalized IntFire4 mechanism, called
	IntFire4r: intfire4r.mod
	
Hoc-file defining a network of IntFire4r cells: IF4rNetwork.hoc
	
Session files bringing up a little GUI for plotting model behavior in
4 different initial conditions:
	IF4rFigures.hoc

Execution:

After compilation of intfire4r.mod (mknrndll with PC and MAC,
nrnivmodl under linux) run IF4rFigures.hoc in NEURON. This will load
intfire4r cells and bring up a panel with four choices ++,+-,-+,-- and
three graphs. The first+/- indicates whether the model starts with a
positive (+) or negative (-) dm/dt, the second +/- indicates whether
the model starts above (+) or below (-) m=0. The graphs show the
currents e (E), i2 (I) and the membrane potential m (M).

For example running "++" will generate figures such as:
